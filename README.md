# Weather Dashboard

## Project Description

The Weather Dashboard is a minimalist, responsive React web application that provides real-time weather data for cities around the world. Users can search for a city using an intuitive search bar with autocomplete suggestions. Upon selection, the dashboard displays relevant weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and forecast using data fetched from a weather API.

This project is designed for ease of use, clean UI aesthetics, and extensibility. It serves as a foundational template for developers looking to build or extend weather-based applications using React.
